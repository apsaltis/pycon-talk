Thanks, Jessica, for introducing the goals of the event.

I want to take a few minutes and explain exactly how the Boston
Python Workshop for women and their friends works.

It's a two-day workshop. On Friday, people set up their computers
to learn Python. They also practice the basics of navigating the
command line, running Python code, and using the interpreter.

Then, on Saturday, attendees work through an interactive lecture
on some more advanced programming -- functions, modules, flow
control, things like that -- and then they break for lunch. They
practice these things some more, getting help from TAs as needed,
and then they choose between different hands-on projects.

Let's talk more about Friday.

In the setup portion of Friday, students get our help installing
the Python interpreter. We've repeatedly honed these instructions
so students don't fall into traps -- for exmaple, on Windows, after
you install Python, if you type Python into a prompt you'll get "Command
not found." Since we discovered this, we have students add Python to their system path.
And as newcomers, how many of you have had problems mixing tabs and spaces?
Our workshop attendees follow configuration instructions
so that they're all soft tabs, 4 spaces wide. We also show the students
the basics of using a terminal on their platform, since that's the
most common development environment for Python.

We also have students download the code they need so that they can work on
any of Saturday's projects smoothly, without interruption.

Finally, we have them practice the basics of Python, going through a
simple tutorial we've written and trying out the interpreter.

All this information is on the web, shared under a permissive Creative Commons

So when students come back on Saturday, they're ready to dive in.

The first part of Saturday is the more advanced lecture. We cover topics
that students will need to make sense of the projects, and nothing more.
It took some work to fit all this into two hours. We explain modules,
functions, loops and conditionals, dictionaries and lists.  The lecture is
interactive -- we ask students to type along to what they see, and there's
time to answer questions as people ask them.

Then we break for lunch. We've managed to arrange food sponsors so far for
all five of our workshops. You can see that Jessica does the hard work,
giving the lecture; I showed up just in time for lunch for this workshop.

After lunch, for an hour, students practice Python some more.
It might seem a little like
drilling them, but it really helps when we get to the hands-on projects.

So let's talk about those! We have three hands-on projects that students
can work on. In the two hours remaining, students pick two projects to
work on for one hour each. If they're interested in graphics, they try the
ColorWall, our simulation of a grid of LED lights. That turns out to be an
exercise in nested for loops. Many students really like the Twitter API project,
where they experiment with Tweeting and searching from within Python. And
some students really enjoy the WordPlay project, where they answer questions about
words that would fit on a scrabble grid. We like to call it, Cheating at Words
with Friends.

The projects are split into some lecture -- to explain core concepts like regular
expressions and give students a tour of the code -- and then we ask them to dive
in, editing the code for each project to solve exercises. It's a lot of learning
for one day.

Saturday ends with a wrap-up. We talk with students about how they
can continue learning Python after the workshop, pointing them to
good introductory resources. We remind them of the various things
you can do with Python, and, while the students are still there, we
ask them to fill out an exit survey so we know how the day went.

Well, that's how the workshop works. Jessica, can you talk about
how we've affected Boston Python group?

Jessica explained how the workshop has affected the Boston Python
user group. I want to highlight some of the hidden aspects of the
Workshop, the stuff that operates behind the scenes to help us succeed.

First of all, I have to say thank you to the dozens of people who've
volunteered with us.
